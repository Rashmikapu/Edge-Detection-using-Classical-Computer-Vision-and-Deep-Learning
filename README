This is the project for CMSC733 Homework 0 - Alohamora


--> All the code files for Phase1 and Phase2 are executed on Google colab.
   
   Phase 1 - Phase1/Code/phase1.ipynb
   
   Phase 2 - Phase2/Code/phase2.ipynb

--> All the required folders and code files are in Code directory in both the phases

--> Paths are given in .ipynb files according to the author's drive structure. These paths need to be
   changed everywhere accordingly. 


--> Outputs and plots for both the phases can be seen in Code/Outputs. The cells in .ipynb files are
    executed and the outputs can be seen as cell outputs.

--> Phase 2 runs on Tensorflow 1, but due to limitations of tf1 usage on Google Colab,
    the starter code has been modified accordingly. This needs to be changed accordingly for
    different versions of Tensorflow.
    
--> Cifar10 data was not zipped in this submission. Please download the images from homework page
    and link it to the .ipynb file to run the code.
